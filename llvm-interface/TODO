Limitations and missing features (identified so far):

- look at shouldAssumeDSOLocal in clang to see what we should do
- volatile needs to be passed by reference (RB09-002, RB09-011, RM C.6(19))
- warn on UC of different size and use undef (see, e.g., 7816-003)
  maybe related to next item
- materialize bounds from 0 to 'Last for foreign array param (2315-001)
- deal with recording positions for package bodies (can already do when
  generating code, but not when pushing for elab proc)
- more __sync builtins and other atomic builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines (e.g., J917-030)
- representation clauses
- debug info (for variables, types and parameters)
- restriction checks done by back end (other than no elab and allocations,
  which are done)
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- support for stack checking
- suport for -gnatc (when back-annotating)
- pragma Link_Contructor and Link_Destructor (see E519-019)
- pragma Linker_Alias (see E611-001)
- must allocate aliased components of records early (GA23-024)
