Missing features (identified so far):

- out parameters for scalars passed by value
- more __sync builtins and other atomic builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines
- reduce generation of elaboration code on e.g. aggregates (see system.ads)
- Unchecked_Union
- freeze nodes for types and subprograms (see c38102a)
- very long compilation time in some cases (see various XFAIL in acats, and
  output.adb in bootstrap)
- representation clauses
- debug info (for variables, types and parameters)
- restriction checks done by back end
- support for code generation switches (in particular -Ox and possibly some
  -fxxx switches)
- compile subprograms in inlined list
