Missing features (identified so far):

- deal with recording positions for package bodies (can already do when
  generating code, but not when pushing for elab proc)
- address clauses on subprograms (maybe respecting freeze nodes), see cd30005
- packed array types are not working properly
- more __sync builtins and other atomic builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines
- Unchecked_Union
- freeze nodes for types and subprograms (see c38102a)
- very long compilation time in some cases (see various XFAIL in acats, and
  output.adb in bootstrap)
- representation clauses
- debug info (for variables, types and parameters)
- restriction checks done by back end (other than no elab, which is done)
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- compile subprograms in inlined list
