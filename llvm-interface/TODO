Limitations and missing features (identified so far):

- see if can convert aggregate to array to avoid elab (e.g., FC16-002)
- look at shouldAssumeDSOLocal in clang to see what we should do
- deal with recording positions for package bodies (can already do when
  generating code, but not when pushing for elab proc; see S313-017)
- call "_ext" version of raise routines (e.g., J917-030)
- debug info for non C compatible types
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- deal with alignment for Atomic fields
- track alignment of GL_Values
