- more __sync builtins and other atomic and bswap builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines
- Do_Overflow_Check on conversions
- handle goto / loop exits out of blocks
- reduce generation of elaboration code on e.g. aggregates (see system.ads)
- freeze nodes for types and subprograms (see c38102a)
- representation clauses
- debug info (for variables, types and parameters)
- restriction checks done by back end
- support for code generation switches (in particular -Ox and possibly some
  -fxxx switches)
- support for stack checking (-fstack-check)
