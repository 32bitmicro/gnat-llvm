Limitations and missing features (identified so far):

- see if can convert aggregate to array to avoid elab (e.g., FC16-002)
- look at shouldAssumeDSOLocal in clang to see what we should do
- debug info for non C compatible types
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- track alignment of GL_Values
