Limitations and missing features (identified so far):

- volatile needs to be passed by reference (RB09-002)
- warn on UC of different size and use undef (see, e.g., 7816-003)
  maybe related to next item
- materialize bounds from 0 to 'Last for foreign array param (2315-001)
- deal with recording positions for package bodies (can already do when
  generating code, but not when pushing for elab proc)
- more __sync builtins and other atomic builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines
- representation clauses
- back annotation
- debug info (for variables, types and parameters)
- restriction checks done by back end (other than no elab and allocations,
  which are done)
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- support for stack checking
- See if can use .rodata (see I305-025)
- pragma Weak_External (see IB12-009)
- -gnatc and back-annotation
