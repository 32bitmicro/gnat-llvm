Limitations and missing features (identified so far):

- do better in avoiding array bitfield fields (FC16-002)
- when have convention C and array, change to pointer to element type
  this causes cxb3008 to fail in the optimizer with -O2 and an optimizing build
- look at shouldAssumeDSOLocal in clang to see what we should do
- volatile needs to be passed by reference (RB09-002, RB09-011, RM C.6(19))
- warn on UC of different size and use undef (see, e.g., 7816-003)
  maybe related to next item
- materialize bounds from 0 to 'Last for foreign array param (2315-001)
- deal with recording positions for package bodies (can already do when
  generating code, but not when pushing for elab proc; see S313-017)
- more __sync builtins and other atomic builtins
- call "_ext" version of raise routines (e.g., J917-030)
- debug info for non C compatible types
- support for some -fxxx and -m (e.g -mtune) code generation switches
- support for -gnatc (when back-annotating), see H218-58
- need not use indirect for variable that's of known size but nonnnative type
- deal with alignment for Atomic fields
