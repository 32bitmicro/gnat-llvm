Missing main features (identified so far):

- support calling builtins that generate LLVM IR
- out parameters for scalars passed by value
- call "_ext" version of raise routines
- handle goto / return out of blocks
- freeze nodes for types and subprograms (see c38102a)
- representation clauses
- debug info (for variables and types)
- restriction checks done by back end
