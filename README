This is an experimental LLVM backend to the GNAT translator: do not expect it
to work for a few months...

In order to build GNAT-LLVM from sources, you need fo follow the following
steps:

-   Copy/move/link the src/ada directory from GNAT sources under this
    directory:

        $ tar xzf [...]/gnat-xxx-src-.tgz
        $ mv gnat-*src/src/ada gnat_src
        $ rm -rf gnat-*src

-   Make sure you have a native version of GNAT which matches this package in
    your PATH

-   Finally build:

        $ make -C llvm-backend

This will create a "ready to use" set of directories "bin" and "lib" under
llvm-backend which you can put in your PATH:

    PATH=$PWD/llvm-backend/bin:$PATH
