This is an experimental LLVM backend to the GNAT front-end.

In order to build GNAT-LLVM from sources, you need fo follow the following
steps:

-   Copy/move/link the src/ada directory from GNAT sources under the
    llvm-backend directory:

    - If you are an AdaCore developer:

    $ cd llvm-backend
    $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.us.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/gnat

    - Otherwise:

    $ tar xzf [...]/gnat-xxx-src.tgz
    $ mv gnat-*src/src/ada llvm-backend/gnat_src
    $ rm -rf gnat-*src

-   Make sure you have a recent native version of GNAT which matches this
    package in your PATH

-   Then build llvm:

    $ make llvm

-   Finally build GNAT-LLVM:

    $ make

This will create a "ready to use" set of directories "bin" and "lib" under
llvm-backend which you can put in your PATH:

    PATH=$PWD/llvm-backend/bin:$PATH

Note for developers: there is a facility to assess the source coverage of
GNAT-LLVM using its testsuite and GNATcoverage. To use it, make sure a
GNATcoverage for a native target is in your path. Then make sure to have a
suitable build:

    $ rm llvm-backend/obj/*
    $ make -C llvm-backend USE_GNATCOV=y

Finally, run the testsuite with the dedicated flag (the source coverage level
is passed as-is to GNATcoverage):

    $ (cd testsuite && ./testsuite.py --srccov-level=stmt+decision)

When the command completes, you can open testsuite/srccov/index.html in a Web
browser.
